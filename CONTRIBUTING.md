Please feel free to report any issues, make any suggestions, request features, and submit pull requests!

If you're interested in writing tests, that would be very helpful. Documentation is also a very important
part of any library, so if you can help with that, that is awesome.

If people start to contribute, I'll find a way for us to chat / communicate.
