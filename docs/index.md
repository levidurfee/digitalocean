# wappr\digitalocean documentation

There is a class for each potential request type. Since some requests have required fields, 
the construct of the request class will require you to pass those parameters. You can then
dynamically create additional properties you would like to pass.

## installation

```bash
$ composer require wappr\digitalocean
```
